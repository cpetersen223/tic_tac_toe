TicTacToe
=========

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil (but not this one) game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

```ruby
gem 'tic_tac_toe'
